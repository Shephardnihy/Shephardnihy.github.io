Each diffraction pattern at a specific beam tilt. A specific reflection is selected for each beam tilt, and stitch together digitally to form a full pattern."

Due to the energy filtering, the plasmon inelastic scattering are removed, making the SAED pattern sharper. The stripes between Bragg reflections indicates the chemical short-range ordering within the sample."

This post holds a collection of my (S)TEM images or diffraction patterns I acquired during my experiments.
