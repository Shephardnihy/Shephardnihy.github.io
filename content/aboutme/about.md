I am Haoyang Ni, a graduate student at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and research intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. My research focuses on using multi-modal scanning transmission electron microscopy, diffraction and spectroscopy to understand strongly correlated quantum phenomena. The key information I am looking into is to probe the local structures and heterogenieties of materials and their impact on quantum state. In the meantime, I deal with large datasets by developing physics-informed analytical methods. As my job is to observe small entities down to picometer-scale ($10^{-12} m$), me as an amateur photographer also takes images of photons coming from lightyears away from the earth! Check out my microscopy photos and photography in "Image Gallery"

## Experimental Skills
- Operation of Thermo Fisher/FEI, JEOL and NION aberration-corrected (scanning) transmission electron microscopes (STEM)
- Atomic-resolution STEM imaging at room and cryogenic temperature
- Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
   - Monochromated EELS for optical properties measurement
   - Momentum-resolved EELS to probe dispersive behavior of exciton and plasmon
- 4D-STEM at both room and cryogenic temperature
   - Atomic-resolution differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging
   - Scanning convergent beam electron diffraction (SCBED) for local crystal symmetry determination
   - Scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) for large-scale domain, phase and strain mapping
   - Lorentz 4D-STEM for imaging magnetic structure in TEM samples
- TEM sample preparation using dual-beam SEM/FIB system
- Extensive python experience for quantitative (4D-)STEM data analysis
- Scripting of Gatan DigitalMicrograph software for customized microscope control
