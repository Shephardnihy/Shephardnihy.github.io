I am Haoyang Ni, a graduate student at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and research intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. My research focuses on using multi-modal scanning transmission electron microscopy, diffraction and spectroscopy to understand strongly correlated quantum phenomena. The key information I am looking into is to probe the local structures and heterogenieties of materials, their consequences and their impact on quantum state. In the meantime, I deal with large datasets by developing physics-informed analytical methods. As my job is to observe small entities down to picometer-scale ($10^{-12} m$), me as an amateur photographer also takes images of photons coming from lightyears away from the earth! Check out my microscopy photos and photography in "Image Gallery"
